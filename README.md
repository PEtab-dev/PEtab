# PEtab -- a data format for specifying parameter estimation problems in systems biology

![Logo](doc/logo/PEtab.png)

*PEtab* is a data format for specifying parameter estimation problems in systems biology.
This repository provides extensive documentation and a Python library for easy
access and validation of *PEtab* files.

## About PEtab

PEtab is built around [SBML](http://sbml.org/) and based on tab-separated values 
(TSV) files. It is meant as a standardized way to provide information for 
parameter estimation, which is out of the current scope of SBML. This includes
for example:

  - Specifying and linking measurements to models

    - Defining model outputs

    - Specifying noise models

  - Specifying parameter bounds for optimization

  - Specifying multiple simulation condition with potentially shared parameters

## Documentation

Documentation of the PEtab data format and Python library is available at
[https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If your project or tool is using PEtab, and you would like to have it listed
here, please let us know.

## Using PEtab

If you would like to use PEtab yourself, please have a look at 
[doc/documentation_data_format.md](doc/documentation_data_format.md) or at
the example models provided in the 
[benchmark collection](https://github.com/Benchmarking-Initiative/Benchmark-Models-PEtab).

To convert your existing parameter estimation problem to the PEtab format, you 
will have to:

1. Specify your model in SBML

1. Set up model outputs and noise model using `AssignmentRule`s as described in 
  the PEtab documentation

1. Create a condition table, if appropriate

1. Create a table of measurements

1. Create a parameter table

If you are using Python, some handy functions of the
[PEtab library](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html) can help
you with that. This include also a PEtab validator called `petablint` which
you can use to check if your files adhere to the PEtab standard. If you have 
further questions regarding PEtab, feel free to post an 
[issue](https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab/issues) at our github repository.

## PEtab Python library

PEtab comes with a Python package for creating, checking, and working with 
PEtab files. This library is available on pypi and the easiest way to install 
it is running

    pip3 install petab
    
It will require Python>=3.6 to run.

Development versions of the PEtab library can be installed using

    pip3 install https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab/archive/develop.zip

(replace `develop` by the branch or commit you would like to install).

When setting up a new parameter estimation problem, the most useful tools will
be:

  - The **PEtab validator**, which is now automatically installed using Python
    entrypoints to be available as a shell command from anywhere called
    `petablint`

  - `petab.create_parameter_df` to create the parameter table, once you
    have set up the model, condition table and measurement table

  - Functions in `petab.migrations` for updating PEtab files from earlier
    versions

## Extending PEtab

We are aware of the fact that PEtab may not serve everybody's needs. If you 
have a suggestion of how to extend PEtab, feel free to post an issue at our 
github repository.
